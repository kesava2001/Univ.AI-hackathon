# Univ.AI-hackathon
# Problem statement
An organization wants to predict who possible defaulters are for the consumer loans product. They have data about historic customer behavior based on what they have observed. Hence when they acquire new customers they want to predict who is more risky and who is not.

# What do you have to do?
You are required to use the training dataset to identify patterns that predict default. Apply the patterns on test dataset to identify “potential” defaulters

# Evaluation Criteria
Submissions will be evaluated on the basis of roc_auc_score. Only the last submission will be considered for the leaderboard.

#Final Result
I ended up with 0.75 roc_auc_score, and myrank is 586/1037
